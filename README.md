# Off-Lattice: System of Self-Driven Particles

Practical Work for the System Simulation 2016 Course at ITBA.

The main objective of this work was to simulate system of particles mentioned in paper _Novel Type of Phase Transition in a System of Self-Driven Particles_, that can be found at ```doc/NovelTypePhaseTransition2.pdf```.

Statement of the practical work can be found at ```doc/TP2_Enunciado.pdf```.

### Examples
